# intel-gpu-notes
Yes, I have all of the desktop/pro variants, this is an attempt to list all of my (public) knowledge about them

## General Links I found useful/pointed to something useful:
- [Towards Data Science Article (yes, I know medium/ripoffs aren't great, but it was a well written article](https://towardsdatascience.com/utilizing-intel-arc-xe-matrix-extensions-xmx-using-oneapi-bd39479c9555)

## I'll first start with the arc a40 pro, since it is one of the only gpus that my computer can handle dual booted with a rtx 2070 super (not enough power)
